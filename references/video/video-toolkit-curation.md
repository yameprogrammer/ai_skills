## Programmatic Video (Remotion)

*Write React components. Get MP4s. No timeline editor, no After Effects. Claude describes each frame in TypeScript, Remotion renders it.*

### Remotion Agent Skills (Official)

The official Remotion skill for Claude Code. Went viral in January 2026 — 6M+ views on the launch demo, 25k+ installs in the first week. Teaches Claude how to write correct Remotion code: `useCurrentFrame()`, `interpolate()`, `spring()`, `<Sequence>`, `<Composition>`. Without this, Claude tries to use web animation patterns that break during rendering.

|---|---|
| **Install** | `npx skills add remotion` |
| **Docs** | [remotion.dev/docs/ai/claude-code](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/ai/claude-code) |

One command to install. Then just describe what you want: "Create a 30-second product launch video with logo animation, feature callouts, and a CTA at the end." Claude writes the React components, Remotion renders to MP4.

What it's good for: marketing videos, product demos, data visualizations, explainers, branded content, onboarding videos. Anything that's motion graphics rather than live footage.

### Claude Code Video Toolkit (digitalsamba)

The most complete video production setup for Claude Code. Not just a skill — it's a full project template with skills, slash commands, reusable components, transitions, a theme system, brand profiles, and a multi-session project lifecycle.

What's in the box:
- **Skills** — Remotion, ElevenLabs, FFmpeg, Playwright expertise
- **Commands** — `/video` (start a new video project), `/record-demo` (screen recording), `/brand` (create brand profile), `/contribute`
- **9 reusable components** — titles, callouts, transitions, lower thirds
- **7 custom transitions** + 4 official Remotion transitions
- **Theme system** — `ThemeProvider` + `useTheme` for consistent styling
- **Brand profiles** — define colors, fonts, voice settings in `brands/my-brand/`
- **Project lifecycle** — planning, assets, review, audio, editing, rendering, complete

The project system auto-generates a `CLAUDE.md` per video project so Claude can pick up where you left off across sessions.

## Math & Science Animation (Manim)

*The library behind 3Blue1Brown. Python-based, renders LaTeX, graphs, 3D objects, geometric proofs to video. Claude writes the scene code, Manim renders it.*

### Manim Skill (Yusuke710)

Claude Code plugin that handles the full Manim workflow: plan scenes, write code, render video, iterate based on your feedback. Uses Claude's plan mode for scene structure, then writes and renders until all scenes compile.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Author** | Yusuke710 |
| **Install** | `/plugin marketplace add Yusuke710/manim-skill` then `/plugin install manim-skill/manim-skill` |
| **Source** | [Yusuke710/manim-skill](https://github.com/Yusuke710/manim-skill) |

Also installs `manimce-best-practices` from adithya-s-k for correct ManimCE patterns.

### Math-To-Manim (HarleyCoops)

Goes further than a basic Manim skill — three separate AI pipelines (Claude, Gemini, Kimi K2.5) for generating Manim animations from text or images. 55+ working examples across physics, mathematics, CS, cosmology, and finance. Has a Claude Code plugin that requires no setup beyond cloning the repo.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Author** | HarleyCoops |
| **Install** | `git clone` then `claude --plugin-dir ./Math-To-Manim/skill` |
| **Source** | [HarleyCoops/Math-To-Manim](https://github.com/HarleyCoops/Math-To-Manim) |

### Manim MCP Server

Renders Manim scenes as an MCP server. Claude writes the scene code, sends it to the server, gets back a rendered MP4. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP client. Public and open-source.

## Screen Recording & Demos

*Record your app in action. Claude drives a browser via Playwright, records the session, and outputs video.*

### Playwright MCP `--save-video`

Not a separate plugin — just a flag on the Playwright MCP you probably already have installed. Records browser sessions to video file.

```bash
claude mcp add playwright -s user -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --save-video=1920x1080
```

Claude navigates your app, clicks through flows, fills forms — and it's all recorded. Good for product demos, bug reproductions, onboarding walkthroughs. The digitalsamba video toolkit also has a `/record-demo` command that feeds Playwright recordings into Remotion for post-processing (branded intros, transitions, captions).

## YouTube Clipping & Subtitles

### Youtube Clipper Skill — 633 stars

Download YouTube videos, generate AI-powered semantic chapters (not just mechanical time splits), clip segments, translate subtitles to bilingual format, and burn subtitles into videos. Chapters are 2-5 minutes each, based on content analysis.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Author** | op7418 |
| **Install** | `npx skills add https://github.com/op7418/Youtube-clipper-skill` |
| **Source** | [op7418/Youtube-clipper-skill](https://github.com/op7418/Youtube-clipper-skill) |

What it does:
- Downloads video + English subtitles via yt-dlp
- AI analyzes subtitle content to generate semantic chapters
- You pick which chapters to clip
- FFmpeg extracts clips with frame-accurate timing
- Batch translates subtitles to bilingual (default: Chinese/English, 95% API call reduction)
- Burns subtitles into video with customizable styling
- Generates social media summaries for each clip

Requires: `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg` (with libass), `pysrt`.

## FFmpeg & Post-Processing

### FFmpeg Skill (Video Toolkit)

Part of the digitalsamba video toolkit. FFmpeg patterns specifically for Remotion workflows: GIF-to-MP4 conversion (web-friendly flags), resolution/format normalization, CRF-based compression, platform-specific encoding presets, audio extraction, and batch processing.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Source** | [skills.sh/digitalsamba/.../ffmpeg](https://skills.sh/digitalsamba/claude-code-video-toolkit/ffmpeg) |

Common patterns:

```bash
# Normalize to 1080p 30fps for Remotion
ffmpeg -i raw.mp4 \
  -vf "scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1920:1080:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2,fps=30" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow \
  -movflags faststart output.mp4

# Aggressive compression for web preview
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 96k output.mp4

# Batch GIF to MP4
for f in assets/*.gif; do
  ffmpeg -i "$f" -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p \
    -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" \
    "public/demos/$(basename "$f" .gif).mp4"
done
```
